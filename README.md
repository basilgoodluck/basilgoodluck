I'm Basil, and I build software. I'm passionate about creating **robust applications** and **scalable solutions**. My core tech stack revolves around technologies that power modern web development and infrastructure.

I work extensively with **[PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)** - it's the backbone of almost every application I build. The advanced features and reliability make it my go-to database for complex data relationships. I also leverage **[Docker](https://docker.com)** for containerization and deployment, which streamlines development workflows and ensures consistency across environments.

As a **Linux enthusiast**, I primarily work on **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)** servers for hosting and deployment. There's something satisfying about the command line efficiency and the control it provides over the entire development stack.

Currently diving deep into **Discord bot development** and **Web3 technologies**, exploring how blockchain integration can enhance user experiences.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, discuss new ideas, or collaborate on interesting projects. Whether you want to talk about Discord bots, Web3 development, or just share coding experiences.
