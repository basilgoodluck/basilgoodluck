I'm Basil, and I build software. I like making things that work well and solve real problems.
I use **[PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)** for most of my apps - it's reliable and handles complex data really well. **[Docker](https://docker.com)** makes deployment easier and keeps everything consistent across different environments.
I work on **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)** servers for hosting. The command line is fast and gives you full control over everything.
Right now I'm building **Discord bots** and exploring **Web3** stuff, seeing how to make blockchain actually useful for users.
